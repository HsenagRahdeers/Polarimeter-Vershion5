Welcome to Polarimeter-Vershion5!

This Python code provides a user-friendly GUI for using the polarimeter. It communicates with the Arduino over a serial connection at a baud rate of 115200.

To run the polarimeter, simply enter the port name and click on the "start" button. You can use the "write" button to save data to a .csv file, and the "history" button to access previously saved data.

If you're using Linux, the port should be something like "/dev/ttyACM0" or "/dev/ttyACM1". For Windows, it should be "COM6" or "COM7".

Please note that the provided MATLAB live script is slightly outdated and was originally made for Polarimeter V3. Feel free to make appropriate changes as needed.

Thank you for using Polarimeter-Vershion5!
