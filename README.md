# Polarimeter-Vershion5

The python code here gives you a nice GUI to use the polarimeter. It communicates to the Arduino over serial at 115200 baud rate. 
Enter portname and click on start to run the polarimeter, use the "write" button to write data to a .csv file, and "history" button to read old data.
On Linux, the port should look something like "/dev/ttyACM0" or "/dev/ttyACM1". For windows, it should be something like "COM6" or "COM7".
